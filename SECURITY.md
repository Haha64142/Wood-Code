# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version is supported. If a security vulnerability is found in an older version, check if it exists in the lastest dev-version.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability exists in the latest version, please submit an security report in the security tab. Please include as much info as you can in the report.
If the vulnerability is confirmed, I will try to get the fix out in the next minor update.
